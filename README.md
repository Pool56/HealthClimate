_INSTRUCTIONS: Below are the suggested sections to include in your README file to make sure your project is well documented. You can remove this instruction text._

## Project summary
Our project focuses on aiding people who are affected byclimate change such as asthmatic people. We are creating learning materials in the form of powerpoints for either doctors, pharmacists or climate scientists who are not conversant to IBM technologies such as Watsonx.ai, Watsonx. Assistant and Watsonx. Orchestate. The information is derived from courses in the IBM SkillsBuild. 

### The issue we are hoping to solve

REPLACE THIS SENTENCE with a short description, 2-3 sentences in length, of the specific sustainability problem your solution is meant to address.

### How our technology solution can help

REPLACE THIS SENTENCE with a short description of your team's solution, in about 10 words.

### Our idea

INSTRUCTIONS: Replace this paragraph with a longer description of your solution. In about 500 words, describe your solution in more detail. Include the real-world problem you identified, describe the technological solution you have created, and explain how itâ€™s an improvement over existing solutions. You can supply additional documentation in this source code repository that you link to as well.

More detail is available in our [description document](./docs/DESCRIPTION.md).

## Technology implementation

### IBM watsonx product(s) used

_INSTRUCTIONS: Included here is a list of IBM watsonx products. Remove any products you did not use. Leave only those included in your solution code. In your official submission on the Call for Code Global Challenge web site, you are required to provide details on where and how you used each IBM watsonx product so judges can review your implementation. Remove these instructions._

**Featured watsonx products**

- [watsonx.ai](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION
- The Watsonx.ai was integrated with the Watsonx.Assistant so as to provide answers which are detailed for easier understanding.
- The watsonx.ai was used for  generation of new text from information obtained from the IBM SkillsBuild.The watsonx.ai was also used in for prediction of weather patterns such as daily precipitation and providing recommendations on what action should be taken. Extreme climatic conditions affect certain  people especially those who are asthmatic

- [watsonx.governance](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-governance) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION
- The watsonx.governance was used to detect levels or presence of copyright infringement from the generated content extracted from IBM SkillsBuild as well as information obtained from webinars and the IBM website.

- [watsonx Assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watsonx-assistant) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION
- Watsonx assistant was integrated with watsonx.ai so as to provide a simple way to perform an integration between a dialog flow and generative AI inferencing services in watsonx.ai.

### Other IBM technology used

IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite was used to examine geospatial, weather and climate data which are main factors that water engineers take into account when drilling boreholes. Cognos Analytics was used so as to formulate AI-powered responses and insights from factors that could affect water access such as examining scope emission report from IBM Envizi so as determine possible level of carbon contamination of water.This insights could be used for making data-driven decisions.



### Solution architecture

REPLACE THIS EXAMPLE WITH YOUR OWN, OR REMOVE THIS EXAMPLE

Diagram and step-by-step description of the flow of our solution:


1. The user navigates to the site and uploads a video file.
2. Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text.
3. Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language.
4. The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage.

## Presentation materials

_INSTRUCTIONS: The following deliverables should be officially posted to your My Team > Submissions section of the [Call for Code Global Challenge resources site](https://cfc-prod.skillsnetwork.site/), but you can also include them here for completeness. Replace the examples seen here with your own deliverable links._
